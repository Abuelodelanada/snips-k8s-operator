# snips.sh Charmed Operator

This repository contains the source code for a Charmed Operator that drives [snips.sh](https://snips.sh/) on Kubernetes.

snips.sh is a passwordless, anonymous SSH-powered pastebin with a human-friendly TUI and web UI.


## Deployment

Assuming you have access to a bootstrapped Juju controller on Kubernetes, you can simply:


Create the Juju model where snips.sh will be running.
```shell
juju add-model snips
```

Deploy snips.sh
```shell
juju deploy snips-k8s
```

After following these steps, you can check everything is ok:

```shell
$ juju status --color

Model  Controller  Cloud/Region        Version  SLA          Timestamp
snips  microk8s    microk8s/localhost  3.0.3    unsupported  02:27:34-03:00

App      Version  Status  Scale  Charm               Channel  Rev  Address         Exposed  Message
snips             active      1  snips-k8s-operator             8  10.152.183.82   no

Unit        Workload  Agent  Address     Ports  Message
snips/0*    active    idle   10.1.75.27

```

## Usage

Now you can create your pastebins by simply:

```shell
$ cat src/charm.py | ssh 10.1.75.27 -p 2222
Pseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal.
