# snips.sh Charmed Operator

This repository contains the source code for a Charmed Operator that drives [snips.sh](https://snips.sh/) on Kubernetes.

snips.sh is a passwordless, anonymous SSH-powered pastebin with a human-friendly TUI and web UI.


## Deployment

Assuming you have access to a bootstrapped Juju controller on Kubernetes, you can simply:


Create the Juju model where snips.sh will be running.
```shell
juju add-model snips
```

Deploy snips.sh
```shell
juju deploy snips-k8s
```

Deploy traefik`and configure Traefik

```shell
juju deploy traefik-k8s traefik

juju config traefik external_hostname="mysnips.sh"

juju config traefik routing_mode="subdomain"
```

Relate snips.sh to Traefik

```shell
juju relate traefik snips
```

After following these steps, you can check everything is ok:

```shell
$ juju status --color --relations
